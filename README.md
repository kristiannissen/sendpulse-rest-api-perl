# sendpulse-rest-api-perl
I needed to switch to a new SMTP service and needed the implementation written in Perl.

So I decided to implement a Perl version inspired by https://github.com/sendpulse/sendpulse-rest-api-php

#To run the tests
perl tests/smtp.pl hello kitty
where hello is client_id and kitty is client_secret
